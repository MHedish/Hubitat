## 🌈 0.5. — Final Stabilization
**App v0.5.7.7 / Driver v0.5.7.4 — Released 2025-12-11**

---

## 🌦️ 0.6.4.x — Pre-Release Stabilization Cycle  
**App v0.6.4.16 / Driver v0.6.4.4 — Released 2025-12-28**

- Unified **data publishing architecture**: renamed `publishSummary()` → `publishZoneData()` and ensured consistent `datasetJson` and per-zone attribute emission.  
- Added **user controls** for publishing modes (JSON vs. attributes) with live toggle validation and automatic cleanup of stale child states.  
- Enhanced **weather alert system** — introduced `rainAlert` and `windAlert` alongside `freezeAlert`, with configurable user thresholds and unit-sensitive behavior.  
- Normalized **forecast handling** across NOAA, OWM, and Tomorrow.io; corrected `wxTimestamp`, `wxSource`, and °F/°C conversions.  
- Improved **meta JSON synchronization** and enforced guaranteed publishing of `summaryText` and `summaryTimestamp`.  
- Refined **logging, initialization, and verification** sequence; ensured deterministic `runWeatherUpdate()` execution.  
- Finalized **UI refinements** — consistent HTML headers, cleaner sections, and improved layout readability.

> Final pre-1.0 release cycle: architectural freeze, consistency audit, and documentation pass in preparation for v1.0.0.0.

## ☀️ 1.0.0.2 — Production Release  
**App v1.0.0.2 / Driver v1.0.0.0 — Released 2025-12-31**

- Introduced **Active Weather Alerts** panel in app UI for immediate visibility of forecast-driven conditions:  
  - 🧊 Freeze/Frost – projected low below configured threshold  
  - 🌧️ Rain – forecast precipitation meets skip criteria  
  - 💨 Wind – forecast wind speed exceeds configured threshold  
- Uses atomicState-backed data for reliable display across reboots and weather-source changes.  
- Added atomicState persistence block in `publishZoneData()` to guarantee alert retention.  
- Refined wind and rain precision (rounded for display while maintaining high-precision ET calculations).  
- Improved accessibility and readability of alert colors (deep amber/red palette).  
- Completed full app/driver consistency audit and schema validation.  
- Finalized pre-1.0 verification suite, marking official stable release.

- 1.0.0.0 — Initial Release.
- 1.0.0.2 — Added hyperlinks to the associated sections of DOCUMENTATION.md to key headings and titles.

## 🌱 1.0.1.x — Attribute Expansion & Stability Pass
**App v1.0.1.0–1.0.1.3 / Driver v1.0.1.0 — Early January 2026**

- Added `baseTime` and `adjustedTime` attributes for improved runtime tracking.
- Introduced `baseTimeUnit` to standardize input (minutes/seconds) across all zones.
- Refined per-zone UI widths and improved visual alignment for configuration pages.
- Implemented automatic validation of runtime values to prevent zero-length cycles.
- Improved event emission and state-change detection for more accurate dashboards.
- Enhanced soil memory performance; reduced redundant logging on update events.
- Began code normalization and cleanup in preparation for scheduler integration.
- Verified attribute publication and JSON payload structure across app/driver.

- Completed foundational architecture for the upcoming scheduler and conflict detection system.

## 🌾 1.0.3.x — Full Scheduler Integration & Weather Intelligence
**App v1.0.3.0–1.0.3.36 / Driver v1.0.3.3 — Late January 2026**

- Introduced **single CRON-based scheduler**, promoting WET-IT from a data provider to a **self-contained, local irrigation scheduler**.
