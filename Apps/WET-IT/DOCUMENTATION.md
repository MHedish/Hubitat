## ☀️ Why Evapotranspiration Matters

Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combined water loss from **soil evaporation** and **plant transpiration**.
It’s the foundation for precision irrigation, ensuring each zone receives just the water it needs.

| Approach | Basis | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 📅️ Fixed Schedule | Time + runtime | Over/under watering |
| 🍃 Seasonal Adjust | Calendar % | Better, but weather-blind |
| 🌱 ET-Based Control | Real weather + soil data | Adaptive precision |

<details>
    <Summary>
		More than you ever wanted to know about the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ET Formula being used:  $$ET_0 = \frac{0.408\Delta(R_n - G) + \gamma\frac{900}{T+273}u_2(e_s - e_a)}{\Delta + \gamma(1+0.34u_2)}$$
	</Summary>

---

🌧️ **The Actual Formulas Used (Industry Standard ET-Based Watering)**<a id="-industry-standard"></a>

Both Rachio and Rain Bird rely on the **FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation** to calculate **Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀)** and then modify watering schedules based on:
-   ET₀ (reference evapotranspiration)
-   Kc (crop coefficient)
-   Root depth
-   Allowed Depletion (MAD)
-   Precipitation (forecast & observed)
-   Soil type
-   Precipitation rate of zone nozzles

The following formulas _are_ the foundation upon which both Rachio and Rain Bird base their calculations.

----------

## 1️⃣ **Reference ET Formula (ET₀ – the global irrigation standard)**<a id="-ET-Formula"></a>

Rain Bird, Rachio, Hunter, Hydrawise, and of course WET-IT, as well as practically all “smart” controllers, use this formula:

### **FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ET Formula**

$$ET_0 = \frac{0.408\Delta(R_n - G) + \gamma\frac{900}{T+273}u_2(e_s - e_a)}{\Delta + \gamma(1+0.34u_2)}$$

Where:

-   **Rn** = net radiation
-   **G** = soil heat flux
-   **T** = mean daily air temp (°C)
-   **u₂** = wind speed at 2 m
-   **eₛ − eₐ** = vapor pressure deficit
-   **Δ** = slope of vapor pressure curve
-   **γ** = psychrometric constant

Weather data comes from NOAA, Hyperlocal PWS, OpenWeather, tomorrow.io, or WeatherBug networks (depending on brand/model).

----------

## 2️⃣ **Actual Water Use for a Specific Plant Zone**

After ET₀, convert to the specific plant type:

$$ETc=ET0×KcET$$​

Where:

- **Kc** = crop coefficient
	- Cool-season turf: 0.65–0.80
	- Warm-season turf: 0.60–0.70
	- Native shrubs: 0.30–0.50

Both Rachio and Rain Bird use similar default Kc tables.

----------

## 3️⃣ **Soil Moisture Balance (Used by Rachio & some Rain Bird models)**

$$Depletion_{today}​=Depletion_{yesterday}​+ETc​−Pe​−Irrigation$$

Where:
- **Pₑ** = effective precipitation (forecast or observed)

Rain Bird controllers (ESP-ME3, LXME2, etc.) **do not** maintain a full soil-moisture bucket; they use ET-adjusted runtime.
Rachio **does** maintain the soil bucket, filling and emptying it daily.

----------

## 4️⃣ **Allowed Depletion (MAD) and Irrigation Trigger**

A zone waters when:

$$Depletion≥MAD×TAW$$

Where:
- **TAW = Total Available Water** in soil

$$TAW=RAW+AW=(FC−PWP)×RootDepth$$

- **MAD** (Management Allowed Depletion)
	- Typically 30–50% for turf
	- Settings vary by plant type

When the bucket empties, Rachio schedules watering.

Rain Bird simply recalculates required minutes directly from ET₀ instead of using a bucket model.

----------

## 5️⃣ **Required Irrigation Depth**

$$Depth_{required}=Depletion$$

Then convert to time:

$$Runtime = \frac{Depth_{required}}{PR}$$​​

Where:

- **PR = precipitation rate** of the zone (in/hr or mm/hr)
----------

## 📌 How Each Brand Implements These Methods

### 🌱 **Rachio’s Method (Full Model – “Flex Daily”)**

Rachio Flex Daily =
**ET₀ → ETC → Soil Bucket → MAD → Required Depth → Runtime Calculation**

They maintain day-by-day soil moisture:

$$SM_{new} = SM_{old} - ET_c + P + IrrigationSMnew​=SMold​−ETc​+P+Irrigation$$

When the bucket empties:

$$WateringTime = \frac{(MAD \times TAW)}{PR}WateringTime=PR(MAD×TAW)​$$

**Weather Forecast Use:**
Rachio _subtracts forecast precipitation_ from future ET deficits and can delay watering if rain is predicted.

----------

### 🌤️ **Rain Bird’s Method**

Rain Bird depends heavily on model:

### **Rain Bird ESP-ME3, ESP-TM2, LNK2 module:**
Uses **ET-based runtime adjustment**, not a soil bucket.

Formula:

$$AdjustedTime = BaseTime \times \frac{ET_c}{ET_{baseline}}AdjustedTime=BaseTime×ETbaseline​ETc​​$$

Where **ET₍baseline₎** is monthly historical ET.

If today’s ET is 30% higher than the baseline, runtimes increase 30%.

### **Rain Bird IQ, LXME2, ESP-LXIVM:**
These commercial controllers can use full ET logic similar to Rachio but still don’t maintain a soil bucket per zone.

----------

## 📡 **Rain Sensor / Weather Intelligence Factors**

Both brands apply:

### **Rain Skip**

$$Skip \text{ if ForecastRain ≥ Threshold}$$

Typically 0.125–0.25 in (3–6 mm)

### **Wind Skip**

$$Skip \text{ if windSpeed — ≥ userThreshold}$$

### **Freeze Skip**

$$Skip \text{ if forecastTemp ≤ freezeLimit}$$

These are simple conditional checks—not formulaic.

### 🌾 From Weather Data to Runtime

Every day, WET-IT fuses live data from your selected provider — **NOAA**, **OpenWeather**, **Tomorrow. io**, or **Tempest PWS** — to compute:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| **ET₀ / ETc** | Daily evapotranspiration and crop-specific loss |
| **Rain Forecast** | Upcoming or observed rainfall |
| **Wind / Freeze Alerts** | Auto-skip logic |
| **Seasonal Factor** | Long-term scaling of runtime budgets |
| **Soil Memory** | Persistent daily depletion tracking per zone |

The system then calculates the **adjusted runtime** for each zone:

$$Runtime_{today} = BaseTime × \frac{ET_c}{ET_{baseline}}$$

If ET is 30% above normal, WET-IT increases watering time 30%.
If soil memory shows the zone still moist from recent rain, it may skip entirely.

---

## 🧭 Configuration Pages Reference

WET-IT includes three primary configuration pages — **Zone Setup**, **Soil Settings**, and **Scheduling** — which define the foundation of irrigation behavior.

Each page affects how programs calculate run times, react to weather, and control hardware.

---

###  🌱 Zone Setup<a id="-zone-setup"></a>

> **Purpose:** Assign and configure individual irrigation zones (valves, relays, or switches).

#### Inputs and Controls

| Input | Type | Description | Example / Notes |
|--------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Zone Name** | Text | Label for this irrigation zone. | e.g. “Front Lawn”, “Garden Beds”. |
| **Zone Device** | Device Selector | Choose the physical switch/relay controlling this zone. | Required for operation. |
| **Active** | Boolean | Enables or disables the zone. | Inactive zones are ignored in runtime and scheduling. |
| **Soil Type** | Enum | Defines water retention/infiltration rate. | Clay, Loam, Sand. |
| **Plant Type** | Enum | Determines ET coefficient for this zone. | Turf, Shrubs, Trees. |
| **Nozzle Type** | Enum | Output rate classification. | Spray, Rotor, Drip. |
| **Base Time Value** | Number | Base watering duration. | Toggle between minutes ↔ seconds. |
| **Base Time Unit** | Toggle Button | Switches display between minutes and seconds. | Updates runtime math automatically. |
| **Adjustment Mode Override** | Enum | Optional override for this zone’s runtime scaling. | Base, Seasonal, ET. |
| **Advanced → Zone Debug Logging** | Boolean | Enables detailed per-zone action logs. | For troubleshooting only. |

#### Behavior

- Each active zone contributes to its assigned program’s total runtime.
- Changing any value recalculates program durations instantly.
- Deleting a zone fully removes its references from both `settings` and `atomicState`.
- Inactive zones remain defined but are excluded from runtime and schedules.

---

### 🌱 Soil Page <a id="-soil-page"></a>

> **Purpose:** Configure soil and environmental characteristics that affect moisture tracking and ET computation.

#### Inputs and Controls

| Input | Type | Description | Example / Notes |
|--------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Soil Type** | Enum | Base soil composition for ET/retention model. | Clay, Loam, Sand. |
| **Field Capacity** | Number (%) | Maximum water content before runoff occurs. | Typical: 30–45%. |
| **Wilting Point** | Number (%) | Minimum moisture before stress. | Typical: 10–15%. |
| **Root Depth** | Number (in/cm) | Depth used to calculate available water. | e.g. 6 in for turf. |
| **Available Water Capacity (AWC)** | Calculated | Derived from soil type and depth. | Auto-calculated field. |
| **Refill %** | Number (%) | Threshold that triggers watering. | Default: 50%. |
| **Advanced → Use Moisture Sensor** | Boolean | Integrates physical moisture devices. | Overrides modeled ET data. |
| **Advanced → Manual Reset** | Action Button | Resets soil moisture to full (100%). | Use after manual watering. |

#### Behavior

- ET and rainfall affect soil moisture between runs.
- Moisture sensors (if enabled) override model predictions.
- Soil configuration impacts every zone assigned to that soil type.
- Updates trigger recalculation of ET budgets and zone runtime scaling.

---

## 📅️ Program Scheduling<a id="-program-scheduling"></a>

WET-IT brings **full irrigation control** to your Hubitat hub — while still serving as a data engine for external automations.

Each **program** defines *when* and *how* zones water.

A program can operate at a **specific clock time**, **start at sunrise**, or uniquely, **end by sunrise** — ensuring irrigation completes just as daylight begins.

---

### ⚙️ Program Structure

Every WET-IT installation supports up to **16 independent programs**, each with:

| Feature | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Name & Active Flag** | Friendly program name and on/off toggle |
| **Program Start Mode** | Fixed Time ⏰, Start at Sunrise 🌅, or End by Sunrise 🌄 |
| **Runtime Method** | Base Only, Seasonal %, or ET-Based |
| **Program Days Mode** | Interval (Every N Days) or Weekly (M/W/F etc.) |
| **Zones** | Select one or more irrigation zones |
| **Weather Skip Controls ** | Freeze ❄, Rain ☔, Wind 💨 avoidance logic |
| **Minimum Runtime Threshold** | Prevents ultra-short runs that could cycle valves unnecessarily. |
| **Buffer Between Programs ** | Minimum time between consecutive programs (minutes) |

Programs run zones sequentially for proper pressure balance and reliability.

Sequential watering avoids conflicts, reduces surge, and ensures deterministic runtime control.

---

### 🔊 Voice Control<a id="-voice-control"></a>

WET-IT supports voice control through Hubitat's built-in **Amazon Echo Skill** by exposing a virtual Echo child device for each irrigation program.

When enabled for a program:

- A dedicated **WET-IT Echo** child device is created 
- The device appears in the Amazon Alexa app as a controllable on/off device
- Turning the device **ON** starts the associated program
- Turning the device **OFF** stops the active program

Each Echo device represents a **single irrigation program**, not a physical valve.

### Naming & Discovery

- Respecting Hubitat's security model, WET-IT cannot automatically determine if you have the **Amazon Echo Skill** enabled.
- After enabling this setting for a program, be sure to enable the new child device in the **Amazon Echo Skill**
- Echo device labels are derived from the program’s friendly name
- When you update the program name, that change automatically cascades to the child device
- An optional `WET-IT` prefix can be enabled per program to avoid name collisions with other smart devices

### Notes

- Echo devices are created and removed automatically based on program settings
- Voice control is optional and does not affect scheduled, automatic, or weather-driven operation

---

### 🌊 Cycle & Soak

Cycle & Soak allows irrigation to be applied in multiple shorter cycles instead of a single continuous run, improving absorption and reducing runoff.

When enabled:

- Each zone’s runtime is divided into multiple watering cycles
- A configurable soak period is inserted between cycles
- Total watering duration remains unchanged

### Benefits

- Reduces runoff on slopes or compacted soil
- Improves water penetration into the root zone
- Increases overall irrigation efficiency

Cycle & Soak is applied automatically during program execution once configured.

---

### 🌤️ Weather Intelligence & Skip Logic

Before each program runs, WET-IT evaluates local conditions from your selected weather provider(s):

| Condition | Trigger | Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Freeze Alert** | Forecast temperature ≤ threshold | Program skipped entirely |
| **Rain Alert** | Forecast rain ≥ threshold | Skip or shorten runtime |
| **Wind Alert** | Forecast wind ≥ threshold | Skip affected zones |
| **Soil Memory** | Zone still moist (ET deficit below threshold) | Skip per-zone watering |

All skip events are logged and reflected in the *WET-IT Data* driver attributes (`freezeAlert`, `rainAlert`, `windAlert`, etc.).

---

###  ⏱ Runtime Calculation

Runtime per zone depends on your chosen **Adjustment Method**:

| Adjustment Mode | Formula | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Base Only** | `Runtime = BaseTime` | Fixed manual runtime |
| **Seasonal Budget** | `Runtime = BaseTime × SeasonalFactor` | Adjusts with month or user input |
| **ET-Based** | `Runtime = BaseTime × (ETc ÷ ETbaseline)` | Auto-tunes daily by live weather |

WET-IT automatically clamps runtimes to valid limits and logs all computations for transparency.

---

### 🧠 Smart Sequencing & Conflict Detection

WET-IT detects overlapping program schedules automatically.
If two programs collide, the later start is delayed by your configured **Program Buffer Delay** (default = 1 minute).
Detected overlaps are displayed in the UI as advisories.

---

### 🧩 Manual Control & Data Continuity

Even with the internal scheduler active, WET-IT continues to function as a **data provider** for custom controllers, dashboards, and integrations.
All computed ET, seasonal, alert, and summary data are published to the **WET-IT Data** child driver as both:

- **Structured JSON** (`datasetJson`) for automation use
- **Individual attributes** for Hubitat dashboards or Rule Machine variables

You can still:
- 🟢 Manually start / 🔴 stop any zone or program
- ⏱ View live countdown and clock-face status
- 💧 Mark Zone Watered to reset ET for a single zone
- 🧹 Mark All Zones Watered to reset all soil depletion

These actions maintain full data integrity across both the scheduler and external automations.

---

### 📊 Control Philosophy

| Mode | Adjustment Basis | Scheduling Source |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Base Only** | Fixed time per zone | Manual or static |
| **Seasonal Budget** | Monthly scaling | Internal or external |
| **ET-Driven** | Live weather & soil model | Internal Scheduler (Sunrise / End-by) |

This architecture keeps WET-IT fully compatible with both **automation frameworks** (Rule Machine, Node-RED, webCoRE) and **fully autonomous scheduling** — one engine, two use cases.

---

### 🌄 Why “End by Sunrise” Matters

Most irrigation systems can only **start at** a fixed time.

WET-IT adds a unique ability — to **“end by” sunrise** — automatically back-calculating when to start so watering finishes right as daylight begins.

This mirrors Rachio’s *Flex Daily* logic and provides:

- 🌞 **Pre-dawn watering** — minimizes evaporation and wind drift
- 🌿 **Dry foliage at sunrise** — prevents fungus and disease
- 💧 **Optimal plant uptake** — watering aligns with morning photosynthesis
- ⚙️ **Automatic runtime compensation** — adjusts dynamically for longer or shorter ET days

> 🕐 *“WET-IT doesn’t just know when to start watering — it knows when you want it to finish.”*

---

### 🌅 Why Early Morning is Best

The best time to water with sprinklers is **early morning, just before or around sunrise (around 5–9 AM)** — to minimize evaporation, allow deep root absorption before heat, and let leaves dry before nightfall, preventing fungus.
Avoid midday watering due to high evaporation and nighttime watering, which promotes disease.

<details>
  <summary>Why Early Morning is Best</summary>

-   **Reduced [Evaporation](https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaporation):**  Cooler air and calmer winds mean less water is lost to the air, ensuring more reaches the roots.
-   **Plant Absorption:**  Water is available when plants are ready to absorb it as the sun rises, making it more efficient.
-   **Disease Prevention:**  Leaves dry as the sun warms up, preventing fungal issues that thrive on prolonged moisture overnight.
-   **Better [Water Pressure](https://www.google.com/search?q=Water+Pressure):**  Municipal pressure is often higher in the early morning.

**Times to Avoid:**

-   **Midday (10 AM – 4 PM):**  High heat and sun cause rapid evaporation, wasting water.
-   **Night (After 6 PM):**  Leaves stay wet for too long, creating ideal conditions for mildew and rust.

**[Evening Watering](https://www.google.com/search?q=Evening+Watering)** (4 – 6 PM) is acceptable if morning isn’t possible but carries a slight fungal risk as temperatures drop overnight.

</details>

> 🌞 *“Sunrise irrigation aligns watering with nature’s rhythm — plants drink when the day begins, not when the day ends.”*

---

### 🔧 Best Practices

- Use **“End by Sunrise”** whenever possible — it delivers maximum efficiency.
- Enable **freeze/rain/wind** skip logic based on local conditions.
- If you own a **Tempest PWS**, enable its integration for hyper-local data.
- Maintain a **minimum runtime ≥ 60 s** for pressure stability.
- Leave a **1–2 minute buffer** between programs to avoid valve overlap.
- Keep the **WET-IT Data** driver installed even if scheduling is disabled — it remains the data backbone for dashboards and custom automations.

---

## 🧩 Sunrise/Sunset Automation Templates

WET-IT started as a data supplier-only project; keeping that in mind, it still supplies real-time **ET budgets** and **timestamps** that can be combined with sunrise/sunset logic in Rule Machine, webCoRE, or Node-RED.

### 🌄 Rule Machine Example (Dynamic Sunrise Trigger)

**Trigger:** `Time occurs at Sunrise + 0 minutes`
**Action Sequence:**
```groovy
Set Variable wetitData = %device:WET-IT Data: datasetJson%
Parse JSON wetitData into json
For each zone:
    runtime = baseMinutes * (json.zones.zone1.etBudgetPct / 100)
    If freezeAlert == false:
        Send command to controller: setZoneRuntime(zone1, runtime)
        Wait until irrigation completes
wetit.markZoneWatered(zone1)
```
Optional: Delay start 15–30 minutes if humidity or rain forecast is high.

---

### 💧 webCoRE Example

- Sets baseline time (in minutes) for each zone.
- Schedules M/W/F at Sunrise excluding winter months.
- Sets 30 second minimum for a zone to water.

![Piston Example](https://github.com/MHedish/Hubitat/blob/main/Apps/WET-IT/images/WebCoRE.png)

---

### ⚙️ Node-RED Example

**Nodes:**
- Inject Node → `sunrise` (daily trigger)
- Hubitat Device Node → `WET-IT Data`
- JSON Node → Parse `datasetJson`
- Function Node:
  ```javascript
  let pct = msg.payload.zones.zone1.etBudgetPct;
  let base = 15;
  let runtime = base * pct / 100;
  msg.payload = { zone: 1, runtime: runtime };
  return msg;
  ```
- Delay Node → Wait for runtime duration
- Hubitat Command Node → `markZoneWatered(1)`

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Add `freezeAlert` check
- Append runtime log to InfluxDB or file output

---

### 🪴 Summary Flow Example

1. 02:00 → WET-IT updates weather (`wxChecked`, `wxTimestamp`)
2. Sunrise → Rule Machine/webCoRE trigger runs irrigation
3. Runtime scaled by ET percentage (`etBudgetPct`)
4. Controller marks completion → WET-IT resets soil depletion
5. Next sunrise → Model recalculates and repeats

> ⚡ *“Legacy controllers gain adaptive intelligence when sunrise becomes the clock.”*

---

## 🌦️ Weather Providers & Alerts<a id="-weather-providers"></a>

WET-IT integrates multiple weather data sources to provide accurate, redundant inputs for **Evapotranspiration (ET)**, **forecast modeling**, and **alert logic**.
Users can select their preferred provider, or WET-IT can automatically fall back to another when conditions or data gaps are detected.

Each source offers unique benefits depending on your climate, hardware, and accuracy needs.

---

### ☁️ Supported Providers

| Provider | API Key | Source Type | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| **NOAA / NWS** | ❌ | Regional (U.S.) | Baseline forecast and observed data. Reliable, free, and always available. |
| **OpenWeather 3.0** | ✅ | Cloud | Global coverage with hourly forecast and precipitation models. Fast and consistent. |
| **Tomorrow. io** | ✅ | Cloud | High-resolution global weather engine with hyperlocal forecast capability. Provides ET₀ and wind metrics natively. |
| **Tempest PWS** | ✅ | Local Hardware | Hyper-local live data from your personal Tempest station. Feeds live rain, temperature, wind, UV, and pressure directly from your yard. |

---

### 🌀 Hybrid Weather Logic

When multiple providers are configured, WET-IT dynamically merges data to create a **hybrid local model**:

1. **Tempest PWS (Primary):**
   Always prioritized for live rain, wind, temperature, and UV.
   Data is considered *authoritative* for local microclimate readings.
2. **Tomorrow.io / OpenWeather (Forecast Layer):**
   Supplies short-term (1–48 hr) forecast data and predictive rain/wind alerts.
   WET-IT uses this layer for *skip-ahead* logic (rain prediction).
3. **NOAA NWS (Fallback & Validation):**
   Provides regional consistency and baseline validation for forecast data.
   Used as a safety fallback if APIs fail or data is incomplete.

If a data source becomes unavailable, WET-IT automatically reverts to the next available provider without interrupting scheduled operations.

---

### 📈 Data Fusion Example

| Data Point | Source Preference | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Temperature / Humidity** | Tempest → Tomorrow.io → OpenWeather → NOAA | Real-time + forecast averages |
| **Wind Speed** | Tempest (live) → Tomorrow.io | Used for `windAlert` and skip logic |
| **Rainfall (Observed)** | Tempest (live rain sensor) | Used to fill soil memory and skip watering |
| **Rain Forecast** | Tomorrow.io → OpenWeather → NOAA | Used to pre-cancel upcoming programs |
| **Solar Radiation / UV** | Tempest → Tomorrow.io | Feeds ET₀ and evapotranspiration modeling |
| **ET₀ / ETc** | Derived from all above | Weighted Penman–Monteith model |
| **Freeze Risk** | Tomorrow.io → NOAA | Used for `freezeAlert` skip logic |

---

### ⚡ Alert Integration

WET-IT continuously publishes weather conditions and alert states to the **WET-IT Data** driver, making them available for dashboards, automations, and notifications.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `freezeAlert` | `bool` | True when forecast or current temp ≤ freeze threshold |
| `freezeAlertText` | `string` | Human-readable summary of freeze condition |
| `rainAlert` | `bool` | True when observed or forecast rain exceeds threshold |
| `rainAlertText` | `string` | Rain warning or forecast details |
| `windAlert` | `bool` | True when sustained or gust speeds exceed limit |
| `windAlertText` | `string` | Wind status or advisory description |
| `rainForecast` | `number` | Predicted rainfall (mm or in) for next 24h |
| `freezeLowTemp` | `number` | Lowest predicted temperature during upcoming window |
| `windSpeed` | `number` | Live or forecast average wind speed |
| `wxChecked` | `string` | Timestamp of last weather poll |
| `wxSource` | `string` | Current provider used for this dataset |
| `wxLocation` | `string` | Provider-specified location label |
| `wxTimestamp` | `string` | Timestamp of latest fetched data |

These attributes are used both for **internal skip logic** and **external automations**, ensuring dashboard consistency regardless of where logic executes.

---

## 🌎 Location Awareness & Geospatial Intelligence

WET-IT is fully location-aware. All weather forecasting, evapotranspiration (ET), seasonal modeling, and soil calculations are **explicitly dependent on geographic location**.

### How Location Is Determined

- WET-IT uses the hub’s configured latitude and longitude as the authoritative source.
- A centralized geolocation cache (`state.geo`) stores:
  - Latitude / longitude
  - Country and ISO-3166-2 subdivision
  - Regional capability flags (e.g., NOAA, USDA availability)
  - Optional regional metadata (e.g., flag)

### Intelligent Caching & Cost Control

- Reverse geocoding and regional probes are **cached** and not repeated unnecessarily.
- Location resolution is refreshed only when:
  - The hub’s latitude or longitude changes
  - Required regional data is missing or incomplete
  - The user manually runs **Verify System**
- Normal app lifecycle events (open, close, initialize) do **not** trigger external geolocation lookups.

### Relocation Detection

If a change in hub location is detected:
- WET-IT logs the previous and current coordinates
- Regional data (weather source eligibility, ISO subdivision, etc.) is refreshed
- If soil memory is enabled, WET-IT warns that existing soil depletion data may no longer be valid and recommends a manual reset

This ensures ET and irrigation decisions remain scientifically consistent after relocation.

### Weather & ET Dependency

All weather forecasts used by WET-IT (NOAA, OpenWeather, Tomorrow.io, Tempest) are **location-specific** and directly influence:
- Rain, freeze, and wind alerts
- ET₀ calculations
- Seasonal and hybrid irrigation budgets
- Saturation and skip logic

Accurate location data is therefore foundational to correct system behavior.

### 🗺️ Location Data Attribution

WET-IT may perform one-time reverse geocoding to determine regional data availability and jurisdictional context.  
Reverse geocoding is provided by **Geoapify**. Map data © **OpenStreetMap contributors**.


---

### 🆕Rain Sensor
- Beginning with v1.0.4.0 users can select any local rain/moisture sensors installed to automatically skip scheduled irrigation events.
- Tempest PWS users can also select their haptic rain sensor.
- Rain sensors are checked just before each scheduled irrigation event.

---

### 🧭 Smart Weather Polling

- **Automatic Refresh:** WET-IT updates all weather data daily (default 02:00 local).
- **On-Demand:** Manual refresh can be triggered via the driver’s *Refresh* command.
- **Adaptive Polling:** Frequency increases automatically during active irrigation seasons.
- **Failover Logic:** If one provider fails or returns invalid data, the system retries with a secondary provider transparently.

Weather updates trigger re-computation of ET values, soil memory, and adjustment percentages immediately.

---

### 🌤️ Using Tempest Data Locally

When a **Tempest PWS** is linked:
- Live rain instantly updates the soil bucket, reducing depletion.
- Real-time wind speed governs skip events (e.g., “too windy to water”).
- UV and solar radiation feed directly into the ET₀ model for same-day accuracy.
- WET-IT automatically aligns Tempest device data with Hubitat’s event timeline, ensuring synchronized driver updates.

Tempest effectively eliminates the “airport effect” — your irrigation is based on **your backyard weather**, not a station miles away.

---

### 🪣 ET & Weather Synchronization

Every weather update recalculates ET₀, ETc, and seasonal adjustments.
This ensures the scheduler’s runtime logic always reflects the latest available conditions.

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Weather Refresh (Auto)** | Daily at 02:00 | Polls all configured providers |
| **Weather Refresh (Manual)** | Via Driver → `Refresh()` | Forces full recompute |
| **ET Recalc** | Any weather change | Recomputes ET₀ / ETc values |
| **Alert Update** | Forecast or observed threshold exceeded | Sends alert and logs state change |

This process guarantees that each day’s irrigation plan is fully informed by **the most recent local conditions**.

---

### 💡 Example Integration (Data Mode Users)

Even if you’re using WET-IT only as a **data provider**, you can leverage these attributes to build automations such as:


>IF device.rainAlert == true THEN
    Cancel all irrigation
ELSE IF device.freezeAlert == true THEN

## 🏢 NOAA Office vs 📡 Radar Station

A  **NOAA office**  is a physical facility where personnel, such as forecasters, work to issue forecasts, warnings, and other hazard information. A  **radar station**  is a specific, uncrewed technical installation containing a radar system  (like the WSR-88D, also known as NEXRAD) that automatically scans the atmosphere and collects raw weather data.

### 🏢 NOAA Office

-   **Function:**  NWS (a part of NOAA) local Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) are staffed by expert meteorologists who analyze the atmosphere, generate localized forecasts, issue timely warnings for their specific region, and broadcast information via NOAA Weather Radio.
-   **Location:**  There are 122 forecast offices across the United States. While some may be located adjacent to a radar, many are miles away from the physical radar tower itself.
-   **Purpose:**  The primary purpose is the human interpretation of data and the dissemination of actionable information to the public and other agencies like first responders and airlines.

### 📡 Radar Station

-   **Function:**  This is the physical site of the radar equipment (antenna, transmitter, receiver housed in a protective dome). It mechanically or electronically scans the atmosphere using radio waves to detect precipitation, wind speed, and direction.
-   **Location:**  Radar stations are strategically placed to ensure broad coverage of the country. The location is chosen for optimal atmospheric scanning, which might not be near a population center or a convenient office location.
-   **Purpose:**  The sole purpose is the automated collection of raw weather data (Level II data, such as reflectivity and radial velocity) which is then sent to the various NWS offices and other users for processing and analysis.

### Key Differences Summary

| Feature | NOAA Office (specifically NWS WFO) | Radar Station |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Primary Role** | Forecast generation, data analysis, issuing warnings, public communication | Automated data collection (raw radar data)|
| **Staffing** | Staffed by meteorologists and support personnel | Uncrewed, an automated technical facility |
| **Output** | Forecasts, warnings, advisories, and other human-analyzed products | Unprocessed radar data (reflectivity, velocity) |
| **Location** | Can be anywhere, often in populated areas or co-located with universities | Located for optimal atmospheric coverage, often remote|

In short, the radar station is a data collection tool, and the NOAA office is where that data is interpreted and transformed into usable weather information.

- Enable **Advanced Debug Mode** only while testing — logs grow quickly.

---

Next: [🌾 Zone Configuration Reference →](#-zone-configuration-reference)

## 🌾 Zone Configuration Reference<a id="-zone-configuration-reference"></a>

Each irrigation **Zone** in WET-IT represents a physical valve or watering area such as turf, garden beds, shrubs, or trees.  
Zone parameters determine how evapotranspiration (ET), soil depletion, and runtime adjustments are applied individually.

---

### ⚙️ Zone Definition

| Setting | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Zone Name** | User-friendly name for each irrigation zone (e.g., “Front Lawn”). |
| **Zone Enabled** | Toggle to include or exclude this zone from scheduling. Disabled zones retain historical ET data but will not run. |
| **Base Runtime (Minutes)** | The nominal watering time at 100 % adjustment under baseline conditions. |
| **Precipitation Rate** | Nozzle output rate (in/hr or mm/hr) used for ET-to-runtime conversion. |
| **Area Type (Plant Type)** | Determines the default crop coefficient (Kc) used for ET adjustments (e.g., Turf, Shrubs, Trees). |
| **Soil Type** | Used to determine water-holding capacity and infiltration rate. Affects MAD (Management Allowed Depletion). |
| **Sun Exposure** | Impacts the daily ET scaling factor; “Full Sun” zones lose water faster than “Partial Shade.” |
| **Slope or Grade** | Optional factor used for per-zone soak cycles or erosion protection logic. |
| **Soil Memory Enabled** | Allows the zone to participate in daily soil depletion tracking and ET-based watering decisions. |

---
### 💦 Valve Control<a id="-valve-control"></a>

WET-IT supports both **`capability.valve`** and **`capability.switch`** devices for each irrigation zone.  
Each zone can have one device assigned for direct activation and runtime tracking.

### ⚙️ Overview
- Every zone can be linked to a single valve or switch device.
- Manual and automatic (program-based) activation are supported.
- Valves are executed **sequentially** to maintain stable water pressure and ensure accurate flow timing.
- Zones without an assigned valve are **automatically skipped** during scheduled runs.

### 🧪 Manual Control
Zones can be tested directly from the UI:
- Tap **“Start Zone Test”** to manually open the assigned valve.
- The app measures runtime and calculates completion percentage.
- Tap **“Stop”** to end the test; WET-IT records the elapsed time for accurate ET adjustments.

### 🛠 Runtime Logic
- Active valves are tracked through `atomicState.manualZone`.
- The system uses `controlValve()` and `closeZoneHandler()` to open, time, and close valves safely.
- Includes protection against overlapping zone activations.
- Manual runs respect **freeze, rain, and wind skips** when enabled.

### 🔍 Attributes & Diagnostics
When valves are controlled by the scheduler or manually:
- **`activeZone`** and **`activeZoneName`** update in real time.
- **`summaryText`** in the data driver includes the current valve and runtime status.
- Diagnostic page tools display the latest valve state and execution logs.

---

### 🧮 Advanced ET & Seasonal Settings

| Setting | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Crop Coefficient (Kc)** | Fine-tunes ET for specific plant types beyond defaults (0.3 – 1.0 typical). |
| **Allowed Depletion (%)** | Defines how much available water may be depleted before irrigation triggers. |
| **ET Baseline Reference** | Localized average ET used to normalize runtime scaling. |
| **Seasonal Adjustment (%)** | Optional manual offset (e.g., +10 % for hot months). |
| **Soil Efficiency (%)** | Adjusts how effectively irrigation water replenishes soil moisture (default 85 %). |

---

### 💧 Runtime Modifiers

| Setting | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Minimum Runtime (Seconds)** | Prevents excessively short valve activations due to small ET corrections. |
| **Maximum Runtime (Minutes)** | Caps ET adjustments to prevent over-watering. |
| **Soak Cycles** | Optional; splits watering into multiple shorter cycles to improve infiltration. |
| **Program Link** | Associates this zone with one or more Program schedules. |
| **Manual Control** | Enables “Run Zone Now” and “Mark Zone Watered” actions from the driver. |

---

### 📈 Zone Data Outputs

When the app runs, each zone publishes real-time data to the **WET-IT Data Driver** using the following attributes:

| Attribute | Example | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `zone#Name` | `zone1Name = "Front Lawn"` | Zone label |
| `zone#Et` | `zone1Et = 0.18` | Current ET depletion (inches or mm) |
| `zone#EtAdjustedTime` | `zone1EtAdjustedTime = 13.9` | Runtime (minutes) after ET & seasonal adjustment |
| `zone#Seasonal` | `zone1Seasonal = 95` | Seasonal adjustment factor (%) |
| `zone#BaseTime` | `zone1BaseTime = 15` | User-configured base runtime |
| `zone#Status` | `zone1Status = "Idle"` | Current zone state (Idle / Running / Skipped) |

---

### 🪣 Soil Memory Example

Each zone maintains its own soil balance:

| Date | ET Loss (in) | Rain Gain (in) | Irrigation Gain (in) | Soil Balance (%) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Jan 12 | 0.18 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 82 |
| Jan 13 | 0.22 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 60 |
| Jan 14 | 0.21 | 0.15 | 0.00 | 56 |
| Jan 15 | 0.00 | 0.35 | 0.00 | 100 |

When balance drops below the MAD threshold, WET-IT automatically schedules watering or flags the zone for manual attention.

---

### 💡 Best Practices

- Assign realistic **precipitation rates** — nozzle data from manufacturer charts works best.  
- Tune **Kc values** by observing plant performance; 0.8–0.9 suits lawns, 0.4–0.6 for shrubs.  
- Enable **Soil Memory** for most zones except newly planted or potted areas.  
- Avoid 100 % shaded zones in ET models unless separate weather data exist.  
- Use **Soak Cycles** for sloped or compacted soil to prevent runoff.  

---

## 🪣 Soil Memory & ET Reset<a id="-soil-memory-et-reset"></a>

The **Soil Memory System** is one of WET-IT’s most powerful features, providing a realistic simulation of how water behaves in your soil between irrigation events.  
It allows zones to “remember” previous rainfall, irrigation, and evapotranspiration (ET) losses — so watering decisions are based on actual conditions rather than a calendar.

---

### 🌱 Concept Overview

Each zone maintains a running **soil water balance** updated daily using ET, rainfall, and irrigation data:

>SoilBalance_today = SoilBalance_yesterday - ET_loss + Rain_gain + Irrigation_gain


The balance is expressed as a percentage of available soil water (0–100 %), and when it falls below the **Management Allowed Depletion (MAD)** threshold, WET-IT triggers irrigation to replenish it.

---

### ⚙️ Key Soil Memory Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Enabled** | Toggles soil modeling per zone or globally. |
| **MAD (%)** | The percentage of soil water that may be lost before watering begins. Typical range: 40–60 %. |
| **Soil Capacity (in or mm)** | The total amount of water the soil can store per unit depth, derived from soil type. |
| **Irrigation Efficiency (%)** | Fraction of applied water effectively stored in the root zone (default = 85 %). |
| **Reset on Manual Watering** | When you manually mark a zone as watered, soil memory resets to 100 %. |
| **Rain Integration** | Converts observed or Tempest-reported rainfall into equivalent soil replenishment. |

---

### 💧 How It Works

1. **Daily ET Update** — The app subtracts ETc (crop-adjusted evapotranspiration) from each zone’s soil balance.  
2. **Rainfall Credit** — Observed rainfall is added immediately after each weather update.  
3. **Irrigation Credit** — When a zone runs, its applied water replenishes soil moisture based on efficiency.  
4. **Threshold Trigger** — If soil moisture ≤ MAD, that zone is eligible for irrigation on the next program run.  
5. **Skip Logic** — Zones above MAD automatically skip until depletion resumes.

This algorithm ensures watering only occurs when the soil *actually needs it*, not simply because a schedule says so.

---

### 🧠 Reset & Maintenance Tools

| Tool / Command | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **`markZoneWatered(zone, percent)`** | Resets soil memory for a single zone. Optionally specify a partial refill % (e.g., 50). |
| **`markAllZonesWatered()`** | Resets all zones to 100 % soil moisture. |
| **`recalculateEt()`** | Forces recalculation of ET values from the latest weather data. |
| **`clearSoilMemory()`** | Clears all stored soil data (advanced use only). |

Use these sparingly; the automatic logic will normally manage everything without manual resets.

---

### 🌦 Integration with Tempest & Rainfall

When using a **Tempest PWS**, live rain data instantly updates soil memory without waiting for the daily refresh.  
Rainfall measured by Tempest populates `rainGain` values in the driver and replenishes the soil balance for all zones.  
Forecasted rain from cloud providers contributes to preemptive skip decisions but does not modify stored soil water until observed.

---

### 📈 Example Zone Water Balance

| Date | ET Loss (in) | Rain Gain (in) | Irrigation Gain (in) | Soil Balance (%) | Action |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Jan 10 | 0.18 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 85 | — |
| Jan 11 | 0.21 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 63 | — |
| Jan 12 | 0.19 | 0.25 | 0.00 | 92 | Rain Refill |
| Jan 13 | 0.22 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 70 | — |
| Jan 14 | 0.20 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 50 | Irrigate Next |

---

### 💡 Tips

- **Do not disable Soil Memory** unless you are running purely fixed-time irrigation.  
- Adjust **MAD** based on soil texture:  
  - Sandy → lower MAD (30–40 %)  
  - Loam → medium (50 %)  
  - Clay → higher (60–70 %)  
- If rainfall sensors overlap with Tempest, disable the redundant input to prevent double-counting.  
- Use **Mark Zone Watered** after manual hose watering to keep soil data accurate.

> Used to calculate evapotranspiration (ET₀ × Kc).

| Plant Type | Description | Typical Kc Range | Example |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Turf (Cool Season) | Cool-climate grasses (fescue, rye) | 0.8–1.0 | Lawns, sports fields |
| Turf (Warm Season) | Heat-tolerant grasses (Bermuda, zoysia) | 0.6–0.8 | Southern lawns |

| Shrubs | Woody ornamentals, perennials | 0.5–0.7 | Foundation plantings |
| Trees | Mature trees, deep roots | 0.3–0.6 | Shade or fruit trees |

---

## 🌾 Soil Type Reference<a id="-soil-type-reference"></a>
> Controls soil moisture retention and depletion rate.

| Soil Type | Field Capacity | Infiltration | Typical Depth | Comments |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Sand | Low | Fast | Shallow | Drains quickly, frequent watering |
| Loamy Sand | Low–Medium | Medium–Fast | Shallow–Medium | Common baseline |
| Loam | Medium | Medium | Moderate | Balanced texture |
| Clay Loam | High | Slow | Deep | High retention, slow infiltration |
| Clay | Very High | Very Slow | Deep | Rarely irrigated, risk of runoff |


## 💧 Irrigation Method Reference<a id="-irrigation-method-reference></a>
> Defines the precipitation rate and efficiency of each irrigation type.  
> Used to calculate zone runtime based on ET-derived water requirements.

| Irrigation Method | Typical Rate (in/hr) | Efficiency | Application Depth | Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Spray | 1.5–2.0 | 60–70 % | Shallow–Moderate | Fixed spray heads with overlapping circular patterns. High precipitation rate, short runtime, prone to wind drift and runoff on slopes. |
| Rotor | 0.4–0.8 | 70–80 % | Moderate–Deep | Gear-driven or impact rotors with slow rotation and broad coverage. Uniform application, less prone to runoff. |
| MP Rotator | 0.4–0.6 | 75–85 % | Moderate–Deep | Multi-trajectory rotating stream nozzle; lower rate for improved uniformity and wind resistance. Excellent for mixed zones. |
| Drip Emitter | 0.2–0.5 | 85–95 % | Targeted | Individual emitters at plant bases or rows. Extremely efficient, minimal evaporation or overspray. |
| Drip Line | 0.3–0.6 | 85–95 % | Targeted | Continuous inline emitters spaced along tubing. Ideal for planters, beds, or long runs. |
| Bubbler | 0.5–2.0 | 80–90 % | Localized | Flood-style emitters for tree wells or basins. High localized rate for deep watering of single plants. |

---

💡 *The app converts the precipitation rate and efficiency into a runtime multiplier for each zone.  
Lower-rate systems (e.g., MP Rotator, Drip) run longer but deliver more uniform moisture with less waste.*

## 🕓 Base Runtime Reference<a id="-base-runtime-reference></a>
> Establishes the **baseline irrigation duration** for each zone.  
> Used with ET and seasonal budget percentages to calculate the final adjusted runtime.

| Parameter | Unit | Description | Notes |
|------------|------|-------------|-------|
| Base Runtime | minutes / seconds | Defines the zone’s standard watering time under normal conditions. | Values **≤ 60** are interpreted as **minutes** and automatically converted to seconds. Values **> 60** are assumed to already be in seconds. |
| Adjusted Runtime | seconds | Calculated automatically by WET-IT based on ET and seasonal adjustments. | Displayed in the Data Driver as `zoneXAdjustedTime`. |
| ET Budget (%) | percent | Dynamic efficiency adjustment derived from evapotranspiration deficit or surplus. | Usually near 100 % for average weather; increases during hot, dry periods. |
| Seasonal Budget (%) | percent | Optional manual or calendar-based adjustment applied after ET calculation. | Allows seasonal offsets for conservation or maintenance. |
---

💡 *In practice:*  
If a zone’s base runtime is **20 min (entered as 20)** and the ET budget is **85 %**,  the system converts this to **20 × 60 = 1,200 s**,  then multiplies by 0.85 → **1,020 s (≈ 17 min adjusted runtime).**

---

## 🗓️ Program Scheduling Reference<a id="-program-scheduling-reference"></a>

Each **Program** defines a complete irrigation routine — including start time, days of operation, included zones, and skip logic.  
Up to **16 independent programs** can be defined per WET-IT instance.

Programs operate sequentially and can run automatically via the internal scheduler or be triggered externally in **Data Provider mode**.

---

### ⚙️ Program Parameters

| Setting | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Program Name** | Friendly identifier for each irrigation program (e.g., “Lawn AM”, “Garden Beds”). |
| **Enabled** | Master toggle to include or exclude a program from scheduling. |
| **Start Mode** | Select *Fixed Time*, *Start at Sunrise*, or *End by Sunrise*. |
| **Start Time** | Manual time value used if *Fixed Time* is selected. |
| **Days Mode** | Choose *Interval* (every N days) or *Weekly* (specific days). |
| **Zones Included** | One or more zones controlled by this program. |
| **Runtime Method** | *Base Only*, *Seasonal Budget*, or *ET-Based*. |
| **Weather Skip Logic** | Enables freeze, wind, and rain skips. |
| **Minimum Runtime (Seconds)** | Skips zones if adjusted time falls below this threshold. |
| **Buffer Between Programs (Minutes)** | Delay before next program starts. Prevents valve overlap. |

---

### 🌧️ Saturation Skip

Saturation Skip automatically prevents irrigation when sufficient moisture is already present based on recent watering activity and calculated depletion.

When active:

- Programs or zones may be **skipped automatically**
- Skip decisions are based on accumulated moisture and depletion tracking
- Normal operation resumes once depletion thresholds are reached

### Key Points

- Saturation Skip operates fully automatically
- Manual program runs override saturation protection
- Skip decisions are logged for transparency and diagnostics

This feature helps conserve water while maintaining consistent and intelligent irrigation behavior.

---

### 🌄 Sunrise and End-by-Sunrise Logic

WET-IT’s scheduler can begin watering **at sunrise** or calculate a start time so the program **ends by sunrise**.  
This is particularly effective in climates with high daytime evaporation or water restrictions.

| Mode | Behavior | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Start at Sunrise** | Begins watering when the sun rises. | Sunrise 6:40 AM → Start 6:40 AM |
| **End by Sunrise** | Calculates start time so watering ends at sunrise. | Sunrise 6:40 AM, total runtime 32 min → Start 6:08 AM |

Advantages:
- 🌞 Minimizes evaporation losses  
- 🌿 Keeps foliage dry by daylight, reducing fungus  
- 💧 Aligns with plant uptake rhythm  
- ⚙️ Dynamically adjusts as sunrise time changes through the season  

> 🕐 *“WET-IT doesn’t just know when to start watering — it knows when you want it to finish.”*

---

### 🌦️ Weather-Based Skip Controls

| Condition | Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Freeze Skip** | Temperature ≤ threshold | Skips entire program if freeze risk detected. |
| **Rain Skip** | Forecast or observed rain ≥ limit | Cancels or shortens affected runs. |
| **Wind Skip** | Forecast wind speed ≥ threshold | Delays or cancels watering under high wind. |
| **Soil Skip** | Soil memory above MAD threshold | Prevents unnecessary watering by zone. |

Skip events appear in the driver and event logs as `ProgramSkipped` notifications, and attributes are updated for dashboard visibility.

---

### ### ⏱ Runtime Adjustments

| Mode | Formula | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Base Only** | `Runtime = BaseTime` | Static run duration per zone. |
| **Seasonal Budget** | `Runtime = BaseTime × SeasonalFactor` | Monthly or user-defined runtime scaling. |
| **ET-Based** | `Runtime = BaseTime × (ETc ÷ ETbaseline)` | Real-time scaling from live ET data. |

Each program’s total runtime is recalculated after every weather update or ET change.

---

### 📊 Logging & Diagnostics

Every execution is logged in Hubitat’s event system and includes:

| Log Entry | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `ProgramStarted` | Program and start time logged. |
| `ZoneStarted` | Each zone start event with runtime. |
| `ZoneSkipped` | Reason for skip (rain, freeze, soil). |
| `ProgramCompleted` | Summary with total duration and completion time. |
| `ProgramSkipped` | Logged when all zones are skipped. |

The summary of each program execution is also published to the **WET-IT Data Driver** under the `summaryText` attribute.

---

### 💡 Tips

- Use *End by Sunrise* for lawn and turf programs — it’s the most water-efficient mode.  
- Keep freeze and rain skip thresholds aligned with local regulations.  
- For long-duration programs, add a **Buffer** of 1–2 minutes between programs.  
- Combine *ET-Based* programs with **Soil Memory** for a fully autonomous system.  
- For testing, temporarily disable skip logic to validate schedule timing.

Next: [🌦 Weather & Alert Settings →](#-weather-alert-settings)

## 🌦 Weather & Alert Settings<a id="-weather-alert-settings"></a>

WET-IT’s weather and alert system enables dynamic watering decisions based on **forecast**, **live data**, and **safety conditions** such as freezing or wind.  
These settings govern how environmental data from NOAA, OpenWeather, Tomorrow.io, or Tempest are interpreted to trigger skips, shorten runtimes, or adjust ET.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration Parameters

| Setting | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Primary Weather Provider** | Selects the main source for ET, temperature, wind, and forecast data. |
| **Backup Weather Provider** | Optional fallback source if the primary fails. |
| **Tempest PWS Integration** | When enabled, live data from your Tempest station is merged into ET and skip logic. |
| **API Keys** | Required for OpenWeather and Tomorrow.io; not required for NOAA or Tempest. |
| **Units** | Choose between *Imperial (°F / in)* or *Metric (°C / mm)*. |
| **Weather Refresh Time** | Default daily update time (02:00 local). Can be adjusted. |
| **Force Weather Refresh Button** | Manually trigger an immediate weather update and ET recalculation. |

---

### 🌡️ Skip Thresholds

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| **Freeze Skip Temperature** | 35°F / 1.7°C | Cancels irrigation when forecast or observed temp ≤ threshold. |
| **Rain Skip Amount** | 0.10 in / 2.5 mm | Minimum forecast or observed rain to trigger a skip. |
| **Wind Skip Speed** | 15 mph / 24 km/h | Maximum allowable wind before skipping watering. |
| **Rain Reset Duration** | 24 hours | Prevents watering for this duration after a qualifying rain event. |
| **Skip Recheck Interval** | 1 hour | Frequency of skip condition re-evaluation before next program run. |

These thresholds ensure irrigation runs only under favorable conditions.

---

### ⚠️ Alert Behavior

| Alert Type | Trigger | Behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Freeze Alert** | Forecast or observed temp ≤ threshold | All programs are suspended until temps recover. |
| **Rain Alert** | Forecast or observed rain ≥ limit | Programs skipped or delayed. |
| **Wind Alert** | Forecast or observed speed ≥ limit | Program delayed or canceled. |
| **Tempest Live Data** | Live rain or wind event | Real-time skip before start or mid-program cancellation. |

When triggered, alerts:
- Publish `*_Alert` attributes in the **WET-IT Data Driver**.  
- Update the app’s dashboard summary.  
- Optionally send Hubitat notifications if configured.

---

### 🧭 Provider Priority Logic

1. **Tempest** (if connected) — live local readings for wind, rain, temperature, and UV.  
2. **Tomorrow. io** — short-range forecast data with high temporal resolution.  
3. **OpenWeather 3.0** — medium-range global forecast and radar-derived rain predictions.  
4. **NOAA / NWS** — baseline source and fallback when cloud data are unavailable.

This order ensures that WET-IT prioritizes **local and current** conditions over regional forecasts.

---

### 🧠 Tips

- Use **Tempest PWS** for the most accurate hyper-local wind and rain data.  
- Keep **NOAA** enabled as a fallback for baseline stability.  
- Adjust **Skip Thresholds** seasonally — lower in winter, higher in summer.  
- Avoid using multiple cloud providers simultaneously unless redundancy is desired.  
- Enable **notifications** during testing to confirm skip logic is firing as expected.

       │<─────────── WET-IT calculates ET since last mark ─┘
```

### 📘 Best Practice

- Always trigger `markZoneWatered()` or `markAllZonesWatered()` **at the end of each watering cycle**.  
- In most setups, this can be done from the same automation that controls the irrigation controller.  
- If your controller manages zones individually, use per-zone marking (`markZoneWatered(zone1)`, etc.).  
- For older single-relay controllers or manual triggers, call `markAllZonesWatered()` once the session ends.

### 🧠 Why It Matters

ET calculations are **time-based**, not daily resets. WET-IT determines soil depletion by measuring how long it’s been since watering — making accurate resets essential for realistic modeling.

---

## 🌧 Rain Protection Logic<a id="-rain-protection-logic"></a>

WET-IT provides multiple layers of **rain protection** to prevent unnecessary irrigation during or before rainfall.  
It combines **forecast-based skip logic**, **live sensor feedback**, and (optionally) **Tempest PWS rainfall data** for maximum reliability.

---

### 🧩 Overview
Rain protection evaluates both predicted and observed precipitation levels:  

- If the **forecast rain total** exceeds the configured threshold, all active irrigation programs are skipped.  
- If any **connected rain or moisture sensors** report a “wet” condition, watering is suspended until they clear.  
- When using a **Tempest PWS**, local rain data is automatically merged with external forecasts for hyper-local accuracy.

The system continuously recalculates rain probability and accumulation whenever a weather update occurs.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration
In the app’s **🌦 Weather Configuration (Advanced)** section:
- Choose a **Rain Skip Threshold** (default: 0.125 in / 3.0 mm).
- Enable or disable **“☔ Skip programs during rain alerts.”**
- Optionally select one or more **Rain / Moisture Sensor devices** with `capability.waterSensor`.
- Specify the **trigger attribute** (e.g., `wet`, `water`, or `moisture`).

If a Tempest station is configured and the setting **“Use Tempest as Rain Sensor”** is enabled, its haptic rainfall sensor will be automatically incorporated even if no external water sensors are selected.

---

### 🧠 Behavior & Recovery
- If rain is forecast or sensors detect moisture, the app sets `rainAlert = true`.  
- The alert clears when both forecast totals and sensor states return below the defined thresholds.  
- Program runs are skipped, and the summary message records the cause (`Rain skip — 0.22in forecast`).
- Rain protection interacts with freeze and wind logic: the highest-priority alert always dominates.  
- When all alerts clear, the scheduler resumes normal operation automatically.

---
## 💨 Wind Protection Logic<a id="-wind-protection-logic"></a>

WET-IT automatically monitors **forecasted and current wind speeds** and will skip irrigation programs when conditions exceed a user-defined threshold.  
This prevents wasted water due to spray drift and uneven distribution, improving efficiency and uniformity.

---

### 🧩 Overview
High winds can cause spray irrigation to **atomize or drift**, reducing the effective coverage area and leading to dry spots or overspray.  
WET-IT’s wind protection logic mitigates this by continuously analyzing forecast wind speeds from your active weather provider.

When the predicted or current wind speed meets or exceeds the configured threshold:
- A **Wind Alert** (`windAlert = true`) is activated.
- All scheduled irrigation programs are skipped until conditions stabilize.
- The app records the event and includes it in the **Active Weather Alerts** summary.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration
In the **🌦 Weather Configuration (Advanced)** section:
- Select a **Wind Skip Threshold** (default: 20 mph / 12 kph).
- Enable or disable **“💨 Skip programs during wind alerts.”**
- Choose your preferred **wind units** (mph or kph), matching the app’s temperature unit setting.

These thresholds are respected across all scheduled and manual runs.

---

### 🧠 Behavior & Recovery
- Wind alerts are evaluated during every weather update and again before each scheduled program execution.
- The alert automatically clears when forecast wind speeds drop below the user-defined threshold.
- If wind remains above threshold for several consecutive updates, the app continues to skip irrigation until conditions normalize.
- The system logs the most recent forecast speed and includes this data in the summary text (`Wind skip — 23 mph forecast`).

---

### 🧾 Published Attributes
When wind protection is active, the WET-IT Data driver publishes:
| Attribute | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `windAlert` | Boolean | True when wind speeds exceed threshold |
| `windSpeed` | Number | Forecast or observed maximum wind speed |
| `windAlertText` | String | Human-readable alert summary (“Wind skip — 25 mph forecast”) |

These attributes can be leveraged in dashboards, automations, and Rule Machine logic to coordinate other devices or notifications.

---

## ⚠️ Active Weather Alerts<a id="-active-weather-alerts"></a>

WET-IT consolidates **Freeze**, **Rain**, and **Wind** alert data into a single **Active Weather Alerts** panel within the app UI.  
This view provides a clear snapshot of current or forecasted conditions that could suspend irrigation programs.

---

### 🧩 Overview
The Active Weather Alerts system merges data from all enabled weather providers and sensors to present:
- Current forecast status (temperature, rainfall, wind speed)
- Alert state (active/inactive)
- A timestamp of the most recent weather update  
- Color-coded icons for immediate recognition:
  - 🧊 **Freeze/Frost** – critical; program execution disabled  
  - 🌧 **Rain** – precipitation detected or predicted; watering suspended  
  - 💨 **Wind** – excessive forecast speed; watering postponed  

This panel updates automatically during every weather refresh cycle or manual diagnostic run.

---

### ⚙️ Operation
- Alerts are derived from the most recent weather provider data (OpenWeather, Tomorrow.io, Tempest, or NOAA).
- Each alert type can be independently enabled or disabled in **Weather Configuration (Advanced)**.
- When any alert is active:
  - The corresponding flag (`freezeAlert`, `rainAlert`, or `windAlert`) is set to `true`.  
  - The system records context data (`freezeLowTemp`, `rainForecast`, `windSpeed`).  
  - A formatted `summaryText` is published for dashboards and notifications.  
- All three alerts are stored in `atomicState` for persistence across hub reboots.

---

### 🧠 Priority & Interaction
If multiple alerts are active simultaneously, WET-IT applies a deterministic priority system to prevent overlap conflicts:

1. **Freeze Alert (🧊)** – highest priority  
2. **Rain Alert (🌧)** – medium priority  
3. **Wind Alert (💨)** – lowest priority  

Example:  
If both a freeze and rain event are active, the system reports **“Freeze Warning”** as the active reason for skipped irrigation.

---


### 🧪 Diagnostics
To verify operation:
1. Run **🔄 Run Weather/ET Updates Now** to refresh wind data.
2. Observe the **💨 Wind** section under **🚨 Active Weather Alerts**.
3. Confirm that the `windAlert` and `windSpeed` attributes in the **WET-IT Data** driver match current conditions.
4. Adjust threshold and units if you wish to fine-tune skip sensitivity.

---






## 💨 Wind Protection Logic

WET-IT monitors forecast wind values.  
If the forecasted windss are ≥ configured **Wind Skip Threshold**, these attributes update automatically:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `windAlert` | bool | True when freeze risk active |
| `windAlertText` | string | 'true' when freeze risk active |
| `windSpeed` | number | Configured temperature threshold |

Automations can safely:  
- Skip irrigation when windAlert = true  
- Send notifications or trigger alerts  
- Resume when forecasted winds will not affect irrigation

## 📊 Data Publishing<a id="-data-publishing"></a>

WET-IT continuously publishes both **summary** and **per-zone data** to its child device — the **WET-IT Data driver**.  
This allows dashboards, Rule Machine, and external systems to access live irrigation intelligence directly from Hubitat.

---
### 🧩 Overview
The app transmits three categories of data:
1. **Summary Data** — Overall weather, alert, and timestamp information.  
2. **Zone Attributes** — ET and seasonal runtime data for each zone.  
3. **JSON Dataset** — Complete snapshot of all zones in machine-readable form.

Publishing occurs automatically whenever:
- Weather data updates (`runWeatherUpdate()` or scheduled refresh)
- ET or seasonal calculations are re-evaluated  
- A program or zone completes execution  
- A manual test or valve run ends  

---

### ⚙️ Configuration
Within **📊 Data Publishing** (app UI):
- **Publish comprehensive zone JSON (default)**  
  - Enables generation of a `datasetJson` attribute with all zones and metrics.  
- **Publish individual zone attributes**  
  - Creates static driver attributes (`zone1Et`, `zone1BaseTime`, etc.) for direct reference.  
- **Summary Text (always published)**  
  - Provides a human-readable line summarizing current status, such as  
    *“ET update complete — 4 zones adjusted, 1 freeze alert active.”*
