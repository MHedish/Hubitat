## 🧩 Overview

The **Rain Bird LNK WiFi Module Controller** driver gives Hubitat users **local, reliable, and deterministic control** of Rain Bird irrigation systems.  
It communicates directly with your controller over LAN — **no cloud, no external accounts, and no internet dependency**.

Now fully optimized for firmware 2.x through 4.x, the driver intelligently adapts its command set for legacy, hybrid, and LNK2 controllers.  
With automatic time sync, real-time zone status, and resilient network handling, it’s designed to “just work” season after season.

---

## ✨ What’s New in v0.0.7.26

✅ **Deterministic schedule handling** — eliminates false positives and event flip-flops  
✅ **Accurate per-program logging** — `${prog}` context now resolves reliably across iterations  
✅ **Improved legacy firmware support** — firmware 2.9+ correctly reports schedule query acknowledgements  
✅ **Refined event model** — one authoritative `programScheduleSupport` event per controller  
✅ **Cleaner logs** — removed redundant “Unsupported” attributes for reduced noise  

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ 100% local control — no internet required  
✅ Supports **LNK** and **LNK2** WiFi modules with adaptive opcode logic  
✅ Time synchronization keeps your controller’s clock accurate  
✅ Per-zone and per-program control with automatic detection  
✅ Rain sensor, rain delay, and water budget reporting  
✅ Built-in diagnostics and event logging for troubleshooting  
✅ Designed for **Hubitat C-7 / C-8 / C-8 Pro** with AES-128 LAN encryption

> 💡 Designed to be *“install and forget”* — once configured, it maintains schedule accuracy, time sync, and controller reliability automatically.

---

## 🧩 Requirements & Compatibility

The driver communicates directly with your controller over **HTTP (port 80)** using Rain Bird’s local JSON protocol.  
Your Hubitat hub and Rain Bird controller must be on the same LAN.

### ✅ Supported Hardware

| Controller Model | WiFi Module | Firmware | Status | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| **ESP-TM2** | LNK / LNK2 | 2.5 – 3.0 | ✅ Stable | Fully compatible; tested on v2.9 |
| **ESP-Me** | LNK / LNK2 | 2.9 – 3.2 | ✅ Stable | Multi-zone + hybrid opcode support |
| **ESP-Me3** | LNK2 | 4.0 + | ⚠️ Partial | Adds extended telemetry (Event Timestamp, Zone Adjust) |
| **ST8 / ST8i** | LNK | 2.5 – 3.0 | ⚠️ Limited | Basic control only |

---

### 💻 Hubitat Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Version | Status |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| **C-7 / C-8 / C-8 Pro** | 2.3.9 + | ✅ Fully tested |

### ⚙️ Device Settings (Preferences)

| Setting | What It Does | Example / Notes |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **IP Address** | The local LAN IP of your Rain Bird LNK or LNK2 module. Must be on the same network as your Hubitat hub. | `192.168.1.50` |
| **Password** | The same password used in the Rain Bird mobile app to access your controller. | `rainbird123` |
| **Number of Zones** | Total number of irrigation zones configured on your controller. <br>💡 *Automatically updated from the controller if supported (ESP-Me / ESP-Me3).* | `6` |
| **Refresh Interval** | How often Hubitat polls the controller to update zone and sensor status. Default = `5 minutes` (range `1–60`). | `5` |
| **Auto Time Sync** | Automatically keeps your controller’s internal clock synchronized with Hubitat. Highly recommended. | ✅ Enabled |
| **Log All Events** | Logs every event (zone changes, rain delays, etc.) to Hubitat’s event history. Recommended for dashboards and event-based rules. | ⚙️ Optional |
| **Debug Logging** | Enables detailed developer logs for troubleshooting. Automatically turns off after 30 minutes. | ⚙️ Optional |

> 💡 *After changing settings, always click **Save Preferences** and then **Configure** to apply changes.*

### 🔍 Preference Notes

- **Auto Time Sync**: Prevents time drift so watering days and times remain correct.  
- **Number of Zones**: Automatically updated for compatible controllers (ESP-Me / ESP-Me3).  
- **Refresh Interval**: Adjust between 1–60 minutes. Use 60 minutes when winterized to reduce network traffic.  
- **Log All Events**: Logs all zone and rain sensor changes.  
- **Debug Logging**: Automatically disables after 30 minutes.

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

Once configured:
1. Click **Refresh** to verify connection.  
2. Use **Run Zone** to start a test zone for a few minutes.  
3. Set a **Rain Delay** (e.g., 1 day) to pause watering during wet weather.  
4. Automate watering using **Hubitat Rules** or **Dashboards**.

> 🌿 *For most users, Hubitat’s Basic Rules app is the simplest way to automate watering schedules.*

---

## 🕒 Keep Your Controller on Time — Automatically

Rain Bird controllers include an internal clock (RTC), but it’s **notoriously inaccurate** — often drifting by **hours or even a full day** over time.  
When that happens, watering schedules can shift to the wrong day or time.

The **Auto Time Sync** feature solves this by keeping the controller’s clock synchronized with your Hubitat hub.  
Hubitat’s time is extremely accurate, so your irrigation programs always run as expected.

### Benefits
- ✅ Watering always happens on the correct day and time  
- ✅ No need to manually reset the date or time  
- ✅ Automatically corrects time after power loss or reboot  

> 💡 *Once enabled, you’ll never have to reset your controller’s date again.*

---

## 🔁 Status Refresh Interval

Hubitat periodically polls the Rain Bird controller to keep its state updated.  
This ensures dashboards and rules always show the correct zone and rain status.

The **default interval** is **5 minutes**, but it can be adjusted from **1 to 60 minutes** to suit your needs.

| Interval | Recommended For | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **1–5 minutes** | Active watering season | Keeps dashboards and automations instantly updated |
| **10–30 minutes** | Normal operation | Reduces network traffic but stays current |
| **60 minutes** | Winterized / off-season | Keeps device connected while minimizing LAN activity |

> 🌱 *If you’ve winterized your irrigation system, set the refresh interval to **60 minutes** to reduce unnecessary checks.*

---

## 💧 Common Commands

You can run these directly from the **Device Commands** section in Hubitat, or include them in automations:

| Command | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|
| **Run Zone** | Start a specific zone for a set number of minutes. |
| **Stop Zone** | Stop watering a specific zone. |
| **Stop All** | Stop all watering activity. |
| **Run Program (A–D)** | Start one of your controller’s preset watering programs. |
| **Set Rain Delay** | Pause watering for 1–14 days. |
| **Stop Irrigation** | Immediately stop all watering operations across all zones. |
| **Disable Debug Logging Now** | Immediately turns off debug logging before the 30-minute timeout. |
| **Refresh** | Manually check the current controller status. |

### Developer Diagnostics

**getCommandSupport(cmdToTest = "4A")**

Queries the Rain Bird controller for support of a specific command opcode (hex string).  
Returns a diagnostic event under `commandSupport` indicating whether the opcode is supported by the current firmware.

Example:
```groovy
getCommandSupport()

'''Logs
Command 0x4A is supported by controller

?? Note: This command is not exposed in the Hubitat device UI by design.
It is intended for advanced users and integrators writing custom Rule Machine or WebCoRE automations.
