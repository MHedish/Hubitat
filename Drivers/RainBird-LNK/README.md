## 🧩 Requirements & Compatibility

The driver is designed for **local-network control** of Rain Bird controllers equipped with an **LNK or LNK2 WiFi Module**.  
It communicates directly over HTTP using Rain Bird’s JSON-RPC protocol — **no cloud or external API dependency.**

### ✅ Supported Hardware

| Controller Model | WiFi Module | Firmware | Status | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| **ESP-TM2**      | LNK / LNK2   | 2.5 – 3.0 | ✅ Stable | Fully compatible; tested on v2.9. |
| **ESP-Me**       | LNK / LNK2   | 2.9 – 3.2 | ✅ Stable | Supports multi-zone and hybrid opcode detection. |
| **ESP-Me3**      | LNK2         | 4.0 +     | ⚠️ Partial | Adds extended telemetry (Event Timestamp, Zone Adjust). |
| **ST8 / ST8i**   | LNK          | 2.5 – 3.0 | ⚠️ Limited | Supports basic control, no extended telemetry. |

> 💡 *All features requiring protocol ≥ 3.x or ≥ 4.x are automatically gated; unsupported requests are silently skipped with debug notice.*

### 💻 Hubitat Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Version | Status |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| **Hubitat Elevation C-7 / C-8 / C-8 Pro** | 2.3.9 + | ✅ Fully tested |
| **Hubitat Elevation C-5** | 2.3.6 + | ⚠️ Works, but slower crypto routines may cause delays |
| **C-4 (Legacy)** | — | ❌ Unsupported (no AES library support) |

> ⚙️ Requires **AES-128 encryption** (built-in on Hubitat 2.3.6 +).  
> 🌐 Operates entirely **LAN-local** — no Rain Bird cloud or account login needed.

### 📡 Network & Access Notes

- Controller and Hubitat hub **must be on the same LAN** and subnet.  
- **Static IP assignment** (DHCP reservation) for the Rain Bird module is highly recommended.  
- The driver communicates over port **80/TCP**.  

---

### 🧰 Optional Configuration

- Automatic time synchronization can be enabled via the **`autoTimeSync`** preference.
- Debug logging is automatically disabled after 30 minutes by default.  
- Refresh interval is user-selectable from **1–60 minutes**, with adaptive back-off logic for unstable networks.

## 💻 Available Commands

These commands can be run manually from the **Device Commands** section in Hubitat or invoked in automations and rules.

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **configure()** | — | Initializes the driver and controller. Should be run after installing or updating the driver. |
| **initialize()** | — | Reinitializes the driver state and schedules periodic refresh tasks. Called automatically by `configure()`. |
| **refresh()** | — | Manually polls the controller for current status, time, date, and all zone states. |
| **driverStatus()** | *(optional)* `String context` | Performs a self-test of communication, time/date retrieval, and reports network health. |
| **runZone(zone, duration)** | `zone (int)`, `duration (int)` | Starts a specific irrigation zone for the given duration (1–120 minutes). |
| **stopZone(zone)** | `zone (int)` | Stops watering for the specified zone. |
| **stopIrrigation()** | — | Stops **all** irrigation activity across zones. |
| **runProgram(programCode)** | `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, or `"D"` | Manually starts one of the controller’s preset programs. |
| **getAvailableStations()** | — | Queries the controller for all active zones. Updates `availableStations` and `zoneCount`. |
| **getWaterBudget()** | — | Retrieves and updates the current seasonal watering percentage. |
| **getZoneSeasonalAdjustments()** | — | Reads individual zone adjustment percentages (protocol ≥ 3.1 required). |
| **getRainSensorState()** | — | Checks the current rain sensor state (`Dry`, `Wet`, or `Bypassed`). |
| **getRainDelay()** | — | Reads the current rain delay in days. |
| **setRainDelay(days)** | `days (0–14)` | Sets a new rain delay value in days. `0` clears any active delay. |
| **setControllerTime()** | — | Syncs the controller’s internal clock to the Hubitat hub’s current time. |
| **syncRainbirdClock()** | — | Forces a full clock resynchronization if drift is detected. |
| **getControllerIdentity()** | — | Queries and displays model, protocol version, and serial number. |
| **getControllerEventTimestamp()** | — | Retrieves the last recorded controller event timestamp (protocol ≥ 4.0). |
| **autoDisableDebugLogging()** | — | Automatically disables debug logging after the timeout period. |

---

### 🧭 Command Execution Notes

- All commands are sent directly over LAN to the module’s `/stick` endpoint.  
- Commands automatically retry up to **3 times** with adaptive backoff and pacing.  
- Successful commands pause briefly (`125 ms`) before returning to prevent packet overlap.  
- Certain protocol features (e.g., `getZoneSeasonalAdjustments`, `getControllerEventTimestamp`) are automatically skipped if the detected firmware version does not support them.

---

### 🔒 Safety and Performance Notes

- Avoid running multiple high-frequency commands in parallel; the Rain Bird API processes requests sequentially.  
- Use **Rules Machine**, **WebCoRE**, or **Basic Rules** with modest delays (`≥1 second`) between command actions.  
- If debug logs show repeated “Backoff” messages, check WiFi signal strength or module power stability.

## 🧠 Advanced Features

### 🕒 Clock Drift Detection & Auto-Sync
The driver monitors controller time and automatically resynchronizes it with Hubitat when drift exceeds tolerance thresholds.

### 🌦️ Rain Delay
Manages and reports controller rain delay status.  
Supports both legacy (36xxxx6B) and variant (B6xxxx) response formats.

### 🧾 Diagnostics
The driver performs a lightweight self-test (`driverStatus()`) during each refresh cycle, verifying communication, time/date responses, and network health.

### ⚡ Adaptive Retry Logic
All Rain Bird commands are sent via `sendRainbirdCommand()`, featuring:
- Up to **3 retry attempts**
- Incremental **250 ms inter-attempt delay**
- **125 ms post-success delay**
- Exponential **network backoff** after consecutive failures (max 900 s)
