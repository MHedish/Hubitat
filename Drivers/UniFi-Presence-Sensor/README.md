## ✨ Features

### Parent Driver: UniFi Presence Controller
- Connects to UniFi Controller / UniFi OS to track presence.  
- Supports **optional Hotspot Child** for guest monitoring.  
- Automatically creates child devices for wireless clients.  
- Provides summaries:  
  - **Child Devices** → “X of Y Present”  
  - **Guest Devices** → “X of Y Present”  
- Bulk management buttons:  
  - **Refresh All Children**  
  - **Reconnect All Children**  
- Exposes UniFi sysinfo:  
  - `deviceType`, `hostName`, `UniFiOS`, `Network`  
- Resilient design: cookie refresh, event filtering (wireless only), disconnect recovery.  
- Logging options (debug & raw events, auto-disable after 30 minutes).  

### Child Driver: UniFi Presence Device
- Works as a **Presence Sensor** in Hubitat.  
- Buttons:  
  - **Arrived**  
  - **Departed**  
- Tracks:  
  - `accessPoint`, `accessPointName`  
  - `ssid`  
  - `presenceChanged` (last change timestamp)  
  - `hotspotGuests`, `totalHotspotClients`  
  - `hotspotGuestList`, `hotspotGuestListRaw`  
- Syncs name/label with parent device automatically.  
- Normalizes MAC formatting (dashes → colons, lowercase).

### ❓ FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: The parent device says `commStatus: error` or never connects.**  
A: Double-check your UniFi Controller IP, site name, username, and password. If using UniFi OS (UDM/UDR/Cloud Key Gen2+), the default port is `443`. For standalone controllers, use `8443`.

---

**Q: My child devices never show as present.**  
A: Ensure the parent driver is connected (`commStatus: good`). If present but still failing, try:  
- Refresh the parent device.  
- Verify the child’s MAC matches UniFi’s format (colons, lowercase).  
- Use *Auto Create Clients* to avoid typos.  

---

**Q: Presence seems “flaky” with lots of false departures.**  
A: Increase the *Disconnect Debounce* time in the parent driver preferences (default = 20s). 30–60s works well in busy Wi-Fi environments.

---

**Q: Can I track UniFi guest hotspot clients?**  
A: Yes. Enable *Hotspot Monitoring* in the parent driver preferences. A special “Guest” child device will be created that shows presence and guest counts.

---

**Q: Does this work with LAN/wired devices?**  
A: No. This driver is focused on **wireless presence only** for efficiency. LAN events are filtered out.

---

**Q: Debug logs are filling up my hub logs.**  
A: Both debug and raw event logging auto-disable after 30 minutes. You can also manually turn them off using the parent device commands.
