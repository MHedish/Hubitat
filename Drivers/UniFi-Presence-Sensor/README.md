# UniFi Presence Sensor for Hubitat

This project provides a **Hubitat parent/child driver pair** that integrates with a UniFi Controller or UniFi OS Console to track device presence and hotspot guests in real time.  

- **Parent Driver** → Manages connection to UniFi Controller (via WebSocket + REST).  
- **Child Driver(s)** → Represent individual clients (phones, laptops, IoT devices) and an optional hotspot guest tracker.  

---

## Features

- Real-time presence detection using UniFi WebSocket events.  
- Debounce handling to smooth transient disconnects.  
- SSID, Access Point MAC + Display Name reporting.  
- **Hotspot support**:  
  - `hotspotGuests` → actively connected clients.  
  - `totalHotspotClients` → non-expired clients (still on guest list).  
- Switch capability for clients → block/unblock devices directly from Hubitat.  
- Debug logging (auto-disables after 30 minutes).  
- Automatic cookie/session refresh to prevent 2-hour flapping (v1.4.8).  
- Import URLs for one-click installation via Hubitat.

## Installation

### 1. Add Drivers
In Hubitat:  
- Go to **Drivers Code → New Driver → Import**.  
- Import each driver using its `importUrl`:  

**Parent Driver:**
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHedish/Hubitat/refs/heads/main/Drivers/UniFi-Presence-Sensor/UniFi_Presence_Controller.groovy?utm_source=chatgpt.com

**Child Driver:**
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHedish/Hubitat/refs/heads/main/Drivers/UniFi-Presence-Sensor/UniFi_Presence_Device.groovy?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Click **Save** for each driver.  

---

### 2. Create Parent Device
- Go to **Devices → Add Virtual Device**.  
- Name it (e.g. `UniFi Presence Controller`).  
- Assign the **UniFi Presence Controller** driver.  

---

### 3. Configure Parent Device
In the parent device settings:  
- Enter **UniFi Controller IP**.  
- Enter **Site Name** (default = `default`).  
- Enter **Username / Password**.  
- Adjust preferences (refresh interval, debounce time, logging).  
- Enable **Hotspot Clients** if desired.  

Click **Save Preferences**.  

---

### 4. Create Child Devices
- From the parent device page, run `createClientDevice("Device Name", "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff")`.  
- The parent will create child devices using the **UniFi Presence Device** driver.  
- A special **Hotspot child** is created automatically if hotspot monitoring is enabled.  

---

## Attributes

### Parent Device
- `commStatus` → Communication status with UniFi.  
- `driverInfo` → Driver version and last modified date.  
- `eventStream` → Raw UniFi events (optional logging).  

### Child Device
- `presence` → present / not present.  
- `accessPoint` → AP MAC.  
- `accessPointName` → Friendly AP name.  
- `ssid` → Wi-Fi SSID (if available).  
- `switch` → on/off = allow/block device.  
- `hotspotGuests` → actively connected hotspot clients (only for hotspot child).  
- `totalHotspotClients` → all non-expired hotspot clients.  

---

## Commands

### Parent Device
- `createClientDevice(name, mac)` → manually add a child.  
- `disableDebugLoggingNow()` → turn off debug logging immediately.  
- `disableRawEventLoggingNow()` → turn off raw UniFi event logging immediately.  

### Child Device
- `arrived()` → manually set presence to present.  
- `departed()` → manually set presence to not present.  
- `on()` → allow device network access (unblock-sta).  
- `off()` → disallow device network access (block-sta).  

---

## Known Good Version

**Current release:**  
- Parent: v1.4.8 (2025.09.01)  
- Child: v1.4.8 (2025.09.01)  

Stable: proactive cookie refresh + presence flapping fix.  

---

## Notes

- Requires HTTPS access to UniFi Controller or UniFi OS Console.  
- Tested against UniFi OS with site API `proxy/network/api/s/[site]`.  
- Debug logs will auto-disable after 30 minutes to reduce noise.

  - Parent: proactive cookie refresh (110m), cleaned refreshFromChild logging.  
  - Child: MAC normalization, synced attributes, aligned with parent release.  
- **v1.4.5 (2025.08.30)**: Stable release, hotspot presence verified via `_last_seen_by_uap`.  
- **v1.3.x**: Introduced hotspot framework, error handling improvements.
